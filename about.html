                    <h2>Our Task</h2>  
                    <p>As a group of seven members, we were tasked to create a web application to allow students and teachers to efficiently collaborate, communicate and interact with each other. To achieve this goal, we implemented areas in the web app for staff members to release announcements to students, for students to submit assignments, for staff members to grade said assignments while providing feedback for the students to view.</p>
                    <p>We added a register and login page to the site to allow users to specify whether they are a student or staff member at their respective organisation, and we created an account page to allow users to edit their personal information.</p>
                    <p>In line with GDPR, we allow all users to download the data we have stored on them and also allow users to delete their accounts if they wish.</p>
                    <p>Through the use of an external hosting service, we can ensure the web app can remain available to users more than 99% of the time, which is crucial for the usability and satisfaction of our users.</p>
                    <p>The use of Google's API's for authentication and realtime back-end database allows for a secure register, login, and personal information storage to give our users peace-of-mind while assisting us in meeting GDPR.</p>

                <div class="ourvision-container">
                    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>Looking forward, we aim to have the web application fully implemented by 28/03/2024. This means that we should have covered all of the functional and non-functional requirements we set out to achieve during stage one of development.</p>
                    <p>As we get closer to the final product, we want to ensure that we have fully implemented the submissions and feedback features, as well as allowing the user to edit their personal information in the account page.</p>
                    <p>The final product shall still be hosted on the same URL to ensure to avoid any complications for the user.</p>
                    <p>We appreciate your patience in waiting for the final product to be released!</p>
                    <p>Happy studying from all of us at the Payperclip team:<br>
